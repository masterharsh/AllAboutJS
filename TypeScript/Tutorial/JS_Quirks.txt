- Lack of type checks
eg: You can assign a number as well as a string to the same variable, or even an object.

- If you have a function, it does not complain if you dont pass the required number of arguments to the function.
It just adds undefined, if the argument is not passed and executes the function.
Similarly you can pass more arguments as well, than are required as per function definition.

- You cannot enforce the structure of objects. Objects are loosely structured in JS.
